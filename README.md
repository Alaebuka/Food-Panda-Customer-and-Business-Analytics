# Food-Panda-Customer-and-Business-Analytics
Exploratory insight from Food Panda Customer and Business Analytics
### Project Introduction
The “Food Panda Business and Customer Insight” project was developed to explore how customer behaviour and delivery performance affect overall business growth. As Food Panda continues to expand, understanding who the customers are, how they engage with the platform, and how efficiently deliveries are handled becomes essential for improving service quality and customer satisfaction.
This project uses Excel for data cleaning and preparation, and Power BI for data visualization and analysis. The dataset contains information such as customer ID, gender, restaurant name, payment method, price, quantity, loyalty points, churn, ratings, and delivery status.
The main goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and insights related to customer age groups, gender, loyalty levels, and churn, as well as to assess delivery performance across different cities. By analysing these factors, the project provides useful insights that can help the business make better decisions, improve delivery operations, and design effective strategies to retain customers and enhance their experience.
### Executive Summary
The project titled “Food Panda Business and Customer Insight” was carried out to understand customer behaviour and delivery performance. Using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for visualization, the analysis focused on customer insights by age, gender, churn rate, and city loyalty, as well as patterns in delivery outcomes. The dataset included information such as customer ID, gender, restaurant name, payment method, price, quantity, loyalty points, churn, ratings, and delivery status.
From the analysis, Teenagers had the highest number of customers (2,062), which was 5.53% higher than Seniors, who had the lowest count at 1,954. Adults followed closely with 1,984 customers. In terms of delivery performance, Delivered orders had the highest average count (412), followed by Delayed (394.40) and Cancelled (393.60). Among the cities, Multan had the highest share of successful deliveries, making up 7.17% of all Delivered orders.
These findings show that younger customers are more active on the platform, and overall delivery performance is strong, though improvements can be made to reduce delays and cancellations.

Recommendation

1. Revenue performance across cities is quite similar, with Multan only slightly ahead, it’s important to identify what factors are driving its lead — such as better promotions, higher customer engagement, or stronger delivery efficiency. Replicating these strategies in other cities could help raise their revenue levels. Additionally, focusing on boosting performance in Karachi, which recorded the lowest revenue, could help balance overall sales across all locations.

2. Pasta generated the highest revenue, efforts should focus on maintaining its strong performance through continued marketing and customer engagement. At the same time, considering that Sandwiches, Pizza, and Burgers also performed well and are close in revenue, introducing combo deals, cross-promotions, or slight menu enhancements could further boost overall sales and help narrow the gap between dishes.

3. To maintain consistent revenue, it’s important to analyze what drove the high performance in January and September—such as promotions, seasonal demand, or marketing campaigns—and apply similar strategies during low-performing months like May. Additionally, planning targeted promotions or customer engagement activities in mid-year could help smooth out the revenue dips and sustain steady growth throughout the year.

4. Since Delivered orders have the highest total and average count, it’s important to maintain the factors contributing to this strong delivery performance—such as timely dispatch, efficient logistics, and customer satisfaction practices. However, the close figures for Delayed and Cancelled deliveries suggest room for improvement. Focusing on identifying the causes of delays and cancellations—like delivery route issues or order handling problems—and addressing them through process optimization or staff training could significantly enhance overall delivery efficiency. Additionally, building on Multan’s positive contribution (7.17% of total delivered orders) can serve as a model for improving performance in other cities.

5. Pizza Hut should focus on improving its customer satisfaction to match its high order volume, perhaps by enhancing service quality or consistency. Burger King should investigate the reasons behind its high cancel rate—such as delays or inaccurate orders—and take corrective measures. KFC’s delivery efficiency can serve as a model for other restaurants to improve overall customer experience and reliability.
